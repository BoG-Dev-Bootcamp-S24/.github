# Dev Bootcamp GitHub Org Guide

## Overview
Welcome to the Dev Bootcamp S24 Organization! This is where all the course lectures, exercises, and projects will live! Bootcampers will each have access to their own repositories where they can upload completed exercises and projects. An organization allows your work to be grouped together, so others can view it. 

## Getting Started
Here are the steps Bootcampers will take in order to get started with the Org. 

- [Exercise 1](https://github.com/BoG-Dev-Bootcamp-S24/bootcamp-s24/tree/main/exer1)
- [Exercise 2](https://github.com/BoG-Dev-Bootcamp-S24/bootcamp-s24/tree/main/exer2)

## Submitting Projects & Exercises
Throughout this bootcamp, bootcampers will submit projects and exercises through GitHub. We will utilize GitHub Organizations to make this happen. 

**Project Repository Links**
- TBD
- TBD

At the beginning of the semester, Bootcampers should fork the `bootcamp-s24` repository in this organization. This repo contains information and starter code for lectures, exercises, and projects. Once the repo is forked, bootcampers should:
- name the new repo `bootcamp-s24-name` in the organization
- clone the repo onto their computer

Bootcampers now have their very own repo in the organization where they can push their code to. Bootcampers should also frequently **Sync Fork** to make sure they have up-to-date exercises and projects.
